My Very First Web Page
Welcome to my very first website!

This website was built as part of the learning material for Code Institute's Fullstack Web Developer program.

You can check out the website here!

Project Description
This site was created in away for me to show my skills that I have learned on HTML and CSS

Technology
This project was written in HTML & CSS using gitpod and is currently hosted on GitHub pages.

Challenges
There was defintely a lot of challenges on the way to completing my site and A LOT of lessons learned! At the start I really did not know how much work went into a beginner/basic website like this and underestimated the time that would need to go into it!

Which for me I feel has drastically impacted the quality of my site (Not a mistake I want to make again!), however I did learn a lot from making simple mistakes with spellings and using the incorrect symbols!

Deciding on what to do the project on was a real struggle for me as in the past I wouldn't of had to been that creative, so I decided to go with a website themed About Me.

Validation
I was able to run my HTML through a W3C validator but low and behold I got hit with a lot of errors my first few goes! I can happily say I've brought those errors down to just a few, however I just couldn't understand the fix behind them which is why I left them in as the code still works it's probably just not as clean.

Thankfully though my CSS went throught the validator with flying colors after a lot of runs! But it's now good!

Changes
I would like to make the following changes in the future:

Proffesional side to the website to include things like my LinkedIn

Clean up the contrast to the site to make it feel more crisp

I would of also liked to change the website completely and go down a different path where it could be a business site.
